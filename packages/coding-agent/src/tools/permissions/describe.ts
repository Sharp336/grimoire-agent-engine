 * *which tools the layer cannot soundly guard*. That half is derived from
 * {@link TOOL_PATH_CLASSES}, so it has to move whenever that table moves. A
 * copy in the command layer would drift silently and start overstating the
 * guarantee — the exact failure this text exists to prevent.
 *
 * Output is plain text with no theme colours: it is rendered through
 * `showStatus` in the TUI and `sessionUpdate` over ACP, and both take a string.
