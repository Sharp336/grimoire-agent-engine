/**
 * Which tool arguments are filesystem paths, and what the tool does with them.
 *
 * Two classes, and the split is the honest boundary of the whole feature:
 *
 * - **structured** — the tool declares its path arguments, so enforcement is
 *   sound. `read`, `write`, `edit`, `grep`, `glob`, `ast_grep`, `ast_edit`,
 *   `lsp`, `debug`, `inspect_image`, `security_scan`.
 * - **opaque** — the tool takes arbitrary code or a command line. `cat .env`
 *   can be spelled `$(echo Lmk|base64 -d)`, so no static analysis is sound
 *   here. These get a best-effort literal scan, which stops accidents and
 *   naive prompt injection and is **not** a sandbox.
 *
 * `pathless` is the third state and exists so the exhaustiveness test can tell
 * "deliberately has no paths" from "nobody classified this yet". An unknown
 * tool name — MCP, extension, custom — defaults to `opaque`, so a new
 * `filesystem/read_file {path: ".env"}` is scanned rather than waved through.
