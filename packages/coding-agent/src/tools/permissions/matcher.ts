/**
 * Glob compilation and matching for permission rules.
 *
 * `Bun.Glob` is the house matcher (14+ callsites) and needs no dependency. The
 * regex forms occasionally requested for command policies are deliberately not
 * supported here: path rules and command rules are different dialects, and
 * conflating them is how a user ends up writing `*.env` and believing nested
 * secrets are covered.
 *
 * `Bun.Glob` accepts any string — a malformed pattern such as `[a-` compiles
 * and then matches nothing rather than throwing (verified: `new
 * Bun.Glob("[a-")` never throws for any input tried against it). That would
 * otherwise leave a typo'd `permissions.deny.*` rule silently unenforced with
 * no error anywhere, so {@link validateGlobPattern} runs at settings load
 * (`config.ts`) rather than relying on a throw that never comes.
 */

/**
 * Cheap, conservative validity check for a glob pattern, independent of
 * `Bun.Glob`'s own (silently-permissive) behavior.
 *
 * Checks only bracket/brace balance — `[...]` character classes and
 * `{...}` brace expansion — the two constructs a truncated pattern most
 * commonly leaves open (`[a-`, `{a,b`). Not a full glob-grammar parser; a
 * pattern that balances but is otherwise nonsensical still compiles (as
 * always) and is the user's own concern. Returns a human-readable problem
 * description, or `null` when the pattern is well-formed.
