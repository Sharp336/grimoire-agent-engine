/**
 * Class B: best-effort literal scan of opaque tool arguments.
 *
 * `bash`, `eval`, `browser`, `computer`, `hub`, and every MCP or extension
 * tool take arbitrary code or a command line. Sound enforcement against that
 * is undecidable — `cat .env` is also `$(echo Lmk|base64 -d)` — so this looks
 * for a *literal* reference to a denied path and nothing more. It stops
 * accidents and naive prompt injection. **It is not a sandbox.** The real
 * boundary for arbitrary code is `tools.approval.bash: deny`, which already
 * exists and is unchanged by this layer.
 *
 * Only deny globs are consulted. Confinement is deliberately not applied here:
 * a shell line naming `/usr/bin/env` is not a write to it, and treating every
 * absolute literal as an escaping write would make the scan unusable.
