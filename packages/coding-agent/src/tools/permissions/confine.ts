/**
 * Symlink-safe containment against N workspace roots.
 *
 * This is `confineToWorkspace` (`../path-utils.ts`) generalized from one root
 * to `[cwd, ...workspace.additionalDirectories]`, sharing its helpers rather
 * than reimplementing them, and preserving its behaviour deliberately:
 *
 * - the roots themselves are realpath-resolved, so a workspace reached through
 *   a link of its own (`/tmp` on macOS) still contains its contents;
 * - an existing target is realpath-resolved outright, so `ws/link/passwd`
 *   under `ws/link -> /etc` is caught;
 * - a target that is itself a *dangling* symlink is refused, because deciding
 *   where it lands would mean reimplementing multi-hop symlink resolution
 *   against a link that can be re-pointed between the check and the write;
 * - otherwise the deepest existing ancestor is resolved and the remaining
 *   segments re-applied, which is the only thing resolvable for a file that
 *   does not exist yet.
 *
 * Three intentional divergences, all consequences of the different input:
 * `confineToWorkspace` guards an untrusted *relative* download path, this
 * guards an *already-resolved absolute* tool target.
 *
 * 1. **A root itself is contained.** A download always names a file; a tool
 *    target may legitimately be a workspace root (`glob path: "."`).
 * 2. **No pre-realpath lexical gate.** `confineToWorkspace` refuses absolute
 *    inputs outright (`path-utils.ts:545`) and then rejects anything lexically
 *    outside its single root before touching the filesystem. Here every input
 *    is absolute, so the equivalent gate would reject every additional root.
 *    A target that is lexically outside but whose realpath lands inside a root
 *    is therefore contained — correct for a multi-root guard, and strictly a
 *    question of which real file is at stake.
 * 3. **The ancestor walk climbs to `/` rather than halting at the root.** It
 *    follows from (2): with no single root to halt at, the walk stops at the
 *    filesystem root. The projected path is checked against every real root
 *    either way, so the outcome is unchanged.
