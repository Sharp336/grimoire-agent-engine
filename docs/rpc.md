# RPC Protocol Reference

RPC mode runs the coding agent as a newline-delimited JSON protocol over stdio.

- **stdin**: commands (`RpcCommand`), extension UI responses, and host-tool updates/results
- **stdout**: a ready frame, command responses (`RpcResponse`), session/agent events, extension UI requests, host-tool requests/cancellations

Primary implementation:

- `src/modes/rpc/rpc-mode.ts`
- `src/modes/rpc/rpc-types.ts`
- `src/session/agent-session.ts`
- `packages/agent/src/agent.ts`
- `packages/agent/src/agent-loop.ts`

## Startup

```bash
omp --mode rpc [regular CLI options]
```

Behavior notes:

- `@file` CLI arguments are rejected in RPC mode.
- RPC startup sets `PI_NO_TITLE=1`, so `prompt` never starts an implicit title-generation model call. Clients control titles explicitly with `set_session_name` or `generate_title`.
- RPC mode resets workflow-altering `todo.*`, `task.*`, `memory.backend`/`memories.enabled`, `advisor.*`, `async.*`, and `bash.autoBackground.*` settings to their built-in defaults instead of inheriting user overrides.
- The process reads stdin as JSONL (`readJsonl(Bun.stdin.stream())`).
- At startup it writes a `ready` frame before processing commands. The frame advertises supported protocol versions, transport limits, and additive capabilities.
- When stdin closes, pending host-tool calls and host-URI requests are rejected and the process exits with code `0`.
- Responses/events are written as one JSON object per line.

## Transport and Framing

Protocol v1 frames are a single JSON object followed by `\n`. Every physical JSONL frame is limited to 1 MiB.

The initial ready frame uses protocol v1 and advertises the opt-in lossless transport:

```json
{
  "type": "ready",
  "protocolVersion": 1,
  "supportedProtocolVersions": [1, 2],
  "capabilities": ["prompt_result", "prompt_lifecycle_disposition"],
  "maxFrameBytes": 1048576,
  "maxReassembledFrameBytes": 67108864
}
```

Clients that support protocol v2 SHOULD immediately send:

```json
{ "id": "protocol-1", "type": "negotiate_protocol", "protocolVersion": 2 }
```

After the success response, oversized stdout objects are emitted losslessly as an uninterrupted sequence of `rpc_chunk` frames. Each chunk carries a base64 segment of the original UTF-8 JSON object:

```json
{
  "type": "rpc_chunk",
  "chunkId": "rpc-1",
  "index": 0,
  "count": 7,
  "byteLength": 1600042,
  "data": "eyJ0eXBlIjoicmVzcG9uc2UiLC4uLn0="
}
```

Clients MUST validate `chunkId`, `index`, `count`, and `byteLength`, reject interleaved or interrupted sequences, enforce the advertised reassembly limit, concatenate decoded bytes in index order, decode them as strict UTF-8, and parse the result as one JSON object. The exported TypeScript `RpcFrameDecoder` implements this validation. The bundled TypeScript and Python `RpcClient` implementations negotiate v2 automatically when the ready frame advertises it.

Legacy clients may ignore the added ready fields and remain on v1. New clients use `capabilities` independently of the transport version: `prompt_result` enables correlated terminal scheduling outcomes, and `prompt_lifecycle_disposition` enables explicit `none` / `current` / `future` run ownership. V1 retains its bounded fallback behavior for oversized output. Frames above the v2 reassembly ceiling still fail explicitly; large history APIs should use pagination rather than depending on arbitrarily large logical frames.

### Outbound frame categories (stdout)

The table below names the 18 asynchronous frames and event variants a standalone client must handle. `context_message_added` is an `AgentSessionEvent`; the other rows are RPC side channels in addition to `ready`, command `response` objects, `rpc_chunk` transport frames, host-tool/URI requests, and the builtin `command_output`, `session_info_update`, and `config_update` side channels.

| Frame | Trigger | Client subscription |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `extension_ui_request` | An extension, login flow, collab host, or tool needs host UI. Requests that expect an answer are completed with `extension_ui_response`. | Automatic; use `RpcClient.onExtensionUiRequest`. |
| `extension_error` | An extension event handler throws. | Automatic raw stdout frame; the TypeScript client has no dedicated listener. |
| `available_commands_update` | Emitted once at startup and whenever slash-command metadata changes. | Automatic; use `RpcClient.onAvailableCommandsUpdate`. |
| `prompt_result` | Every successfully acknowledged `prompt` or `abort_and_prompt` reports whether agent-facing input handled it (`true`) or it completed locally (`false`). Exactly one terminal outcome is emitted and correlated by request `id`; `lifecycleDisposition` is `"none"`, `"current"`, or `"future"` and identifies which run reservation owns the work. | Automatic; use `RpcClient.onPromptResult`, and also `onPromptError` when late scheduling failures must be observed. Use `promptWithResult` or `abortAndPromptWithResult` to retain the acknowledgement request id. |
| `subagent_lifecycle` | A subscribed subagent starts, stops, or changes lifecycle state. | Send `set_subagent_subscription` with `level: "progress"` or `"events"`, then use `RpcClient.onSubagentLifecycle`. |
| `subagent_progress` | A subscribed subagent publishes progress. | Send `set_subagent_subscription` with `level: "progress"` or `"events"`, then use `RpcClient.onSubagentProgress`. |
| `subagent_event` | A subscribed subagent emits its underlying session event. | Send `set_subagent_subscription` with `level: "events"`, then use `RpcClient.onSubagentEvent`. |
| `exec_output` | `bash` or `python` produces an incremental output chunk. | Automatic for those commands; use `RpcClient.onExecOutput` before starting the execution. |
| `settings_update` | Any writer changes a setting's effective value, including `set_setting`, slash commands, and extensions. | Automatic; use `RpcClient.onSettingsUpdate`. |
| `btw_output` | An in-flight `ask_btw` side turn produces text. | Use `RpcClient.onBtwOutput` before `askBtw`; correlate concurrent work by `id`. |
| `idle_recap` | After an agent turn, an idle session with `recap.enabled` waits `recap.idleSeconds` and completes its ephemeral recap turn. | Automatic when enabled in settings; use `RpcClient.onIdleRecap`. |
| `ttsr_generation_event` | `generate_ttsr_rule` streams an `/omfg` draft delta. | Use `RpcClient.onTtsrGenerationEvent` before starting generation; correlate by `id`. |
| `raw_sse_update` | The raw SSE debug capture changes while forwarding is enabled. | Send `subscribe_raw_sse`, listen with `RpcClient.onRawSseUpdate`, and send `unsubscribe_raw_sse` when finished. |
| `mcp_auth_challenge` | An MCP tool call returns `WWW-Authenticate` and blocks pending host input. | Automatic; use `RpcClient.onMcpAuthChallenge`, then answer with `resolve_mcp_auth_challenge`. Omitting `config` rejects the blocked call. |
| `voice_event` | An active realtime or STT controller changes phase/state, reports levels or transcripts, emits a notice, or terminates. | Use `RpcClient.onVoiceEvent` before `start_live`, `start_stt`, or `toggle_stt`. |
| `context_message_added` | The session appends context that the model can act on without adding a normal conversation-history message. | Automatic as part of `AgentSessionEvent`; use `RpcClient.onSessionEvent`. Honor its `display` field. |
| `provider_request_observation` | A subscribed observer snapshots the final `context` or `before_provider_request` provider input after extension rewrites and redaction. | Privileged and off by default. Send `subscribe_provider_request_observations`, listen with `RpcClient.onProviderRequestObservation`, then send `unsubscribe_provider_request_observations`. |
| `extension_ui_cancel` | The server abandons or times out a pending extension UI dialog. | Automatic for pending dialogs; use `RpcClient.onExtensionUiCancel` and close the dialog identified by `targetId`. |

`AgentSessionEvent` remains the primary model/tool stream (`agent_start`, `message_update`, `tool_execution_update`, `agent_end`, compaction/retry events, and related session events). Use `RpcClient.onSessionEvent` for the full session stream or `onEvent` for the core event subset.

#### `exec_output`

All `exec_output` chunks for an execution are queued before its execution `response`; concurrent executions can interleave, so clients correlate streams and responses by `id`. The stream contains raw pre-cap output, while the final result's `output` may be truncated or minimized. Concatenated chunks are therefore not guaranteed to equal the final field.

#### `settings_update`

`settings_update` includes changes made outside `set_setting`, such as `/browser`. Credential paths always carry `value: null`.

#### `context_message_added`

`context_message_added` has shape `{ type: "context_message_added", message: AgentMessage, display: boolean }`. It exposes context the model received and acted on even when that context is not a normal persisted conversation message. A motivating example is the `<system-reminder reason="rule_violation">` injected after a tool call matches a non-interrupting TTSR rule.

Clients MUST preserve the complete `message` bytes for an accurate model-context view, but SHOULD use `display` to decide whether the item belongs in the visible transcript. `display: false` means internal context may be hidden from the conversation renderer; it does not mean the context was absent or ignored by the model.

#### `provider_request_observation`

Provider observation is a privileged diagnostic surface and is OFF by default. Enable it with `subscribe_provider_request_observations` and disable it with `unsubscribe_provider_request_observations`. Every payload is redacted before it crosses the wire.

Frames are correlated by numeric `requestId`. A `stage: "context"` frame carries `messages`; a `stage: "before_provider_request"` frame carries `payload`. Either may include `serializationError`. These observations reveal extension `context` and `before_provider_request` rewrites that never enter message history, so clients MUST NOT treat message history alone as the final provider request.

#### `extension_ui_cancel`

`extension_ui_cancel` has shape `{ type: "extension_ui_cancel", targetId: string, timedOut?: boolean }`. `targetId` names the earlier `extension_ui_request.id`; `timedOut: true` distinguishes deadline expiry from another server-side abort. A client that ignores this frame will leave a dialog open after the server has stopped waiting for it.

### Inbound frame categories (stdin)

1. `RpcCommand`
2. `RpcExtensionUIResponse` (`{ type: "extension_ui_response", ... }`)
3. Host tool updates/results (`host_tool_update`, `host_tool_result`)
4. Host URI results (`host_uri_result`)

## Request/Response Correlation

All commands accept optional `id?: string`.

- If provided, normal command responses echo the same `id`.
- `RpcClient` relies on this for pending-request resolution.

Important edge behavior from runtime:

- Unknown command responses preserve the request `id` when one was provided.
- Parse/handler exceptions in the input loop emit `command: "parse"` with `id: undefined`.
- `prompt` and `abort_and_prompt` return immediate success, then emit either a same-id `prompt_result` or a later same-id error response if async prompt scheduling fails. The TypeScript client exposes both through the typed `onPromptResult` / `onPromptError` subscriptions. `RpcPromptErrorResponse.command` is `"prompt" | "abort_and_prompt"`; use the `requestId` returned by `promptWithResult()` or `abortAndPromptWithResult()` for correlation. Matched immediate failures remain normal command responses and are not also published to the listener.
- Success acknowledgements may include `data.agentInvoked` and `data.lifecycleDisposition` when the server already knows the terminal scheduling outcome. `agentInvoked: false` pairs with `"none"`; `"current"` means the input joined the active run; `"future"` means it owns a queued or newly starting run. Omitted fields mean the outcome is still resolving.
- Consumers that need every terminal prompt outcome subscribe to both listeners. The SDKs retain at most 1,024 timed-out request ids and 1,024 already-reported prompt-error ids in insertion order: late duplicates inside that window are ignored, while bounded eviction prevents lifetime growth.

The high-level TypeScript `promptAndWait()` and Python `prompt_and_wait()` helpers require the advertised `prompt_result` capability. Against an older runtime that omits it, they fail immediately with `code: "capability_unavailable"` and an upgrade message rather than waiting indefinitely. Fire-and-forget prompt methods and all unrelated client APIs remain compatible with that runtime.

## Command Schema (canonical)

`RpcCommand` is defined in `src/modes/rpc/rpc-types.ts`. The list below covers all 181 command discriminants; referenced TypeScript types are exported from the same module.

### Protocol

- `{ id?, type: "negotiate_protocol", protocolVersion: number }`

Only protocol version `2` is currently negotiable.

### Prompting and editor

- `{ id?, type: "prompt", message: string, images?: ImageContent[], streamingBehavior?: "steer" | "followUp" }`
- `{ id?, type: "steer", message: string, images?: ImageContent[] }`
- `{ id?, type: "follow_up", message: string, images?: ImageContent[] }`
- `{ id?, type: "abort" }`
- `{ id?, type: "abort_and_prompt", message: string, images?: ImageContent[] }`
- `{ id?, type: "ask_btw", question: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_last_btw_answer" }`
- `{ id?, type: "cancel_btw" }`
- `{ id?, type: "branch_btw" }`
- `{ id?, type: "complete", lines: string[], cursor: { line: number, column: number } }`
- `{ id?, type: "apply_completion", lines: string[], cursor: { line: number, column: number }, item: RpcCompletionItem }`
- `{ id?, type: "publish_editor_text", text: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "new_session", parentSession?: string }`

`prompt` runs extension `input` hooks before builtin, skill, template, or model dispatch. Prompt text has `@file` mentions expanded server-side; clients MUST NOT repeat that resolution.

`ask_btw` is an ephemeral side turn: text arrives through `btw_output`, the final response contains `{ question, answer, cancelled }`, `cancel_btw` interrupts only the active side turn, and `branch_btw` promotes the retained answer into the main session.

`getEditorText()` in an in-process extension is synchronous. RPC therefore serves it from a server-side cache, not by making a stdio round trip. The host MUST send `publish_editor_text` whenever its local draft changes. Server-issued `set_editor_text` extension requests also update the cache, but otherwise `getEditorText()` remains stale. Extension autocomplete factories participate in both `complete` and `apply_completion`.

#### Completion contract — do not infer a replacement span

`complete` returns `{ items, prefix }`, but `prefix` is match text for display/highlighting, never a replacement span. For a buffer containing `"  /mod"`, the provider may return the same string as `prefix`, while correct application re-anchors at `/` and produces `"  /model "`.

The client MUST send the unchanged buffer, cursor, and selected item to `apply_completion` and use the returned buffer and cursor. It MUST NOT compute or replace a span itself. A failure with `code: "stale_completion"` means the candidate is no longer offered; call `complete` again.

### State and host capabilities

- `{ id?, type: "get_state" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_fast_mode", enabled: boolean }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_available_commands" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_settings" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_setting", path: string, value: unknown }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_extensions", cwd?: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_repo_status", cwd?: string, includePr?: boolean }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_usage_reports" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_todos", phases: TodoPhase[] }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_host_tools", tools: RpcHostToolDefinition[] }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_host_uri_schemes", schemes: RpcHostUriSchemeDefinition[] }`
- `{ id?, type: "subscribe_provider_request_observations" }`
- `{ id?, type: "unsubscribe_provider_request_observations" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_subagent_subscription", level: "off" | "progress" | "events" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_subagents" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_subagent_messages", subagentId?: string, sessionFile?: string, fromByte?: number }`

`get_extensions` defaults to the session cwd and removes the secret-bearing `raw` capability field. Setting `disabledExtensions` configures the next boot; it does not unload active tools or hooks. MCP servers are enabled or disabled through `prompt` with `/mcp enable <name>` or `/mcp disable <name>`.

`get_repo_status` defaults to the session cwd. `includePr` defaults to `false` because it may invoke `gh` and perform a network request. `get_usage_reports` returns `{ reports: UsageReport[] }`.

### Settings

Runtime `ui.options` arrive already resolved. `defaultThinkingLevel` includes the full option list, which clients narrow using the model from `get_state`. Arrays and records are validated only at the container level, matching the config file's trust boundary.

There is no separate reset command. A descriptor with `nullable: true` accepts `null` to clear an undefined-default value; otherwise send the descriptor's `default`.

### Work modes

#### Plan mode

- `{ id?, type: "enter_plan_mode", planFilePath?: string, workflow?: "parallel" | "iterative" }`
- `{ id?, type: "pause_plan_mode" }`
- `{ id?, type: "resume_plan_mode" }`
- `{ id?, type: "exit_plan_mode" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_plan_mode_state" }`
- `{ id?, type: "submit_plan_review", title?: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "approve_plan_proposal", editedContent?: string, strategy?: "execute" | "keep-context" | "compact-context", executionModel?: { provider: string, modelId: string }, thinkingLevel?: ConfiguredThinkingLevel }`
- `{ id?, type: "reject_plan_proposal", feedback?: string }`

Plan commands return `RpcPlanModeSnapshot`, `RpcPlanProposalSnapshot`, or `RpcPlanDecisionResult`. Every plan snapshot includes `paused`. `pause_plan_mode` preserves plan mode as the persisted `plan_paused` session mode and returns `{ enabled: false, paused: true, ... }`; `resume_plan_mode` restores the active plan runtime. Approval may replace the proposal with `editedContent`. `execute` starts a new execution session, `keep-context` executes in the current context, and `compact-context` compacts the current context before execution. `executionModel` and `thinkingLevel` select the execution turn. A collaboration guest cannot use `strategy: "execute"` until it calls `leave_collab_session`; the proposal remains pending and plan mode remains active.

#### Goal and guided-goal modes

- `{ id?, type: "create_goal", objective: string, tokenBudget?: number }`
- `{ id?, type: "pause_goal" }`
- `{ id?, type: "resume_goal" }`
- `{ id?, type: "switch_goal", objective: string, tokenBudget?: number }`
- `{ id?, type: "clear_goal" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_goal_budget", tokenBudget: number | null }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_goal_state" }`
- `{ id?, type: "begin_guided_goal", initialObjective?: string }` → `{ queued: boolean }`

Goal mode is autonomous. Creating a goal while idle immediately starts its first agent turn; after each completed turn the RPC goal scheduler can submit the next continuation while the goal remains active. A streaming session receives goal context as steering instead. `begin_guided_goal` mirrors the TUI command: it validates preconditions, exposes the `goal` tool, and injects a synthetic kickoff prompt. `queued: true` means that kickoff is a follow-up behind an active turn; `false` means direct submission. The guided interview is normal conversation: clients send answers with `prompt`, and the agent completes it with `goal create`.

#### Vibe and aggregate state

- `{ id?, type: "enter_vibe_mode" }`
- `{ id?, type: "exit_vibe_mode" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_vibe_mode_state" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_work_mode_state" }`

Vibe snapshots expose active/ephemeral tools and worker state. `get_work_mode_state` returns the active mode plus plan, goal, and vibe snapshots.

### Runtime control

- `{ id?, type: "enable_loop", prompt: string, action?: "prompt" | "compact" | "reset", count?: number, durationMs?: number }`
- `{ id?, type: "disable_loop" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_loop_state" }`
- `{ id?, type: "cancel_loop_iteration" }`
- `{ id?, type: "pause_agents" }`
- `{ id?, type: "resume_agents" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_pause_state" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_session_tree" }`

Loop state reports `enabled`, `state`, `action`, `prompt`, and an optional iteration or duration limit. `cancel_loop_iteration` pauses future repeats and aborts only the active loop turn. `action: "reset"` starts a new session and is rejected for collaboration guests before the loop is enabled; call `leave_collab_session` first. Other loop actions are unchanged. Pause commands operate on the process-wide agent pause gate.

`get_session_tree` returns `{ leafId, tree }`. Every node's `id` is a valid `navigate_tree.targetId`; clients MUST use these ids rather than deriving targets from messages or labels.

### Subagent control

- `{ id?, type: "get_controllable_agents" }`
- `{ id?, type: "revive_agent", agentId: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "kill_agent", agentId: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "prompt_agent", agentId: string, text: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "spawn_background_agent", work: string }`

`get_controllable_agents` reads the shared Agent Hub registry and includes persisted subagents discovered after a process restart. It returns live and parked status plus session-file identity. `revive_agent`, `kill_agent`, and `prompt_agent` target one registered agent; `spawn_background_agent` dispatches the canonical `/tan` workflow.

### Authoring

#### Advisor and TTSR rules

- `{ id?, type: "get_advisor_config", scope: "project" | "user" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_advisor_config", scope: "project" | "user", instructions: string | null, advisors: RpcAdvisorConfig[] }`
- `{ id?, type: "generate_ttsr_rule", complaint: string, feedback?: string, previousRule?: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "build_ttsr_rule", name: string, description: string, conditions: string[], scopes: string[], body: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "register_ttsr_rule", scope: "project" | "user", name: string, description: string, conditions: string[], scopes: string[], body: string, overwrite: boolean }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_ttsr_rules" }`
- `{ id?, type: "remove_ttsr_rule", name: string, deletePersisted: boolean }`

Advisor writes update the live merged roster. `build_ttsr_rule` provides manual canonical validation; `generate_ttsr_rule` is the model-backed `/omfg` flow and emits `ttsr_generation_event` deltas. Supplying both `feedback` and `previousRule` requests an amendment. Registration persists and installs a rule in the live TTSR manager; removal can optionally delete its persisted authoring file.

#### Agent definitions

- `{ id?, type: "get_agent_definitions" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_agent_definition", name: string, scope: ("project" | "user") | null }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_agent_definition", scope: "project" | "user", name: string, content: string, overwrite: boolean }`
- `{ id?, type: "delete_agent_definition", scope: "project" | "user", name: string }`

Passing `scope: null` reads the effective definition. Only project/user definitions are writable or deletable; bundled and extension-owned definitions remain read-only.

#### Hindsight mental models

- `{ id?, type: "get_mental_models", detail: MentalModelDetail }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_mental_model", mentalModelId: string, detail: MentalModelDetail }`
- `{ id?, type: "create_mental_model", name: string, sourceQuery: string, mentalModelId: string | null, tags: string[] | null, maxTokens: number | null, mode: MentalModelMode | null, refreshAfterConsolidation: boolean | null }`
- `{ id?, type: "refresh_mental_model", mentalModelId: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "refresh_auto_mental_models" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_mental_model_history", mentalModelId: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "seed_mental_models" }`
- `{ id?, type: "delete_mental_model", mentalModelId: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "reload_mental_models" }`

These commands operate on the active Hindsight bank. Bulk refresh and seeding results include successful/queued ids and per-id failures; clients MUST inspect those arrays rather than treating a successful command response as proof that every item succeeded.

### Presentation

- `{ id?, type: "get_theme" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_keybindings" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_session_view" }`

`get_theme` returns every resolved semantic color and symbol. `get_keybindings` returns `{ keybindings }` entries with action, keys, display text, and optional description. `get_session_view` reports session presentation inputs not already in `get_state`.

### Model and thinking

- `{ id?, type: "set_model", provider: string, modelId: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_model_temporary", provider: string, modelId: string, thinkingLevel?: ConfiguredThinkingLevel, ephemeral?: boolean }`
- `{ id?, type: "cycle_model", direction?: "forward" | "backward" }`
- `{ id?, type: "cycle_role_models", roleOrder: string[], direction?: "forward" | "backward" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_available_models" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_model_roles" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_model_role", role: string, model: string, scope: "global" | "project" }`
- `{ id?, type: "clear_model_role", role: string, scope: "global" | "project" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_thinking_level", level: ThinkingLevel }`
- `{ id?, type: "cycle_thinking_level" }`

`get_model_roles` returns effective role assignments with the supplying layer as `provenance: "runtime" | "overlay" | "project" | "global" | "default"`. Set and clear operations persist one role in the requested global or project layer and return the updated snapshot.

### Queue, compaction, and retry

- `{ id?, type: "set_steering_mode", mode: "all" | "one-at-a-time" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_follow_up_mode", mode: "all" | "one-at-a-time" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_interrupt_mode", mode: "immediate" | "wait" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_queued_messages" }`
- `{ id?, type: "pop_queued_message" }`
- `{ id?, type: "clear_queue" }`
- `{ id?, type: "compact", customInstructions?: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_auto_compaction", enabled: boolean }`
- `{ id?, type: "retry" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_auto_retry", enabled: boolean }`
- `{ id?, type: "abort_retry" }`

`get_queued_messages` returns the steering and follow-up queues. `pop_queued_message` removes the next restorable message, and `clear_queue` returns the queues after clearing them.

### Shell and Python

- `{ id?, type: "bash", command: string, excludeFromContext?: boolean, useUserShell?: boolean, followCwd?: boolean }`
- `{ id?, type: "abort_bash" }`
- `{ id?, type: "python", code: string, excludeFromContext?: boolean }`
- `{ id?, type: "abort_python" }`

`excludeFromContext` prevents the execution result from entering session context. `bash` uses configured user-shell routing by default; set `useUserShell: false` to disable it. With `followCwd: true`, a successful, non-cancelled command whose `BashResult.workingDir` is absolute reconciles the session cwd to that directory; the default is `false`.

### Session

- `{ id?, type: "get_session_stats" }`
- `{ id?, type: "export_html", outputPath?: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "switch_session", sessionPath: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_sessions", scope?: "cwd" | "all", cwd?: string, query?: string, limit?: number }`
- `{ id?, type: "delete_session", sessionPath: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_prompt_history", cwd?: string, query?: string, limit?: number }`
- `{ id?, type: "branch", entryId: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "fork" }`
- `{ id?, type: "navigate_tree", targetId: string, summarize?: boolean, customInstructions?: string, allowAskReopen?: boolean, reanswerAskResult?: AgentToolResult<AskToolDetails> }`
- `{ id?, type: "resume_after_ask_reanswer" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_branch_messages" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_last_assistant_text" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_session_name", name: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "generate_title", text: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "handoff", customInstructions?: string }`

`switch_session.sessionPath` accepts an absolute path, a session-id prefix, a session filename prefix, or a partial title. Id and filename-prefix resolution checks the current workspace and then the global session list; if neither matches, partial-title resolution follows the same local-then-global order. No match returns `code: "unknown_session"`. Switching across projects reconciles the live cwd and its cwd-dependent runtime state to the destination session.

`new_session`, `switch_session`, `branch`, and `fork` reconcile work modes around the change. The outgoing session's transient runtime is released without persisting anything — plan and goal give their pre-mode tools and model back, and vibe workers are suspended rather than killed — so the destination hydrates from a clean base and a mode-less target inherits no mode tooling. A change reported as `cancelled: true`, or one that fails before commit, leaves the still-current session operational with its recorded mode, tools, model, hosted collaboration relay, voice capture, and process-local vibe workers intact; hosting, voice, and suspended workers are released only once the change commits. These four commands and deletion of the active session fail with `code: "operation_failed"` while joined as a collaboration guest; call `leave_collab_session` first.

When `switch_session` resolves to the active session file, path identity uses the runtime's platform-aware canonical comparison (including Windows casing and separators). This is a reload, not a destructive switch: RPC rolls the reversible work-mode suspension back, preserves process-local vibe workers and the RPC subagent registry, and keeps session-owned attachments. Switching to a different logical file remains destructive.

A transition that aborts the outgoing provider turn and then fails before commit does not resurrect that cancelled turn. It reconnects the restored session and automatically consumes its restored steering, follow-up, or deferred hidden queue so the session returns to normal operation without a manual prompt.

`get_sessions` defaults to the current cwd and a limit of 100, supports case-insensitive full-text substring filtering, and caps the limit at 1,000. `cwd` selects another workspace when `scope` is not `"all"`. Results are sorted by newest modification time and omit `allMessagesText`.

Deleting the active session uses the canonical drop/new-session path so the live session never points at a deleted file; it may return `code: "cancelled"` if that transition is cancelled. A non-active path not owned by the session index returns `code: "unknown_session"`.

`navigate_tree` returns navigation state including optional ask-reopen/reanswer fields. After a committed historical ask reanswer, send `resume_after_ask_reanswer` once the host has rebuilt its transcript. `generate_title` performs the explicit model call, applies the result to the active session, emits `session_info_update` when applied, and returns `{ title, applied }`. `set_session_name` applies a client-provided title without a model call. Ordinary `prompt` commands never generate or change titles.

Prompt-history search defaults to the session cwd and a limit of 100, clamped to 1–1,000. Entries contain `text`, optional `cwd`, optional `sessionId`, and optional ISO-8601 `at`.

### Messages

- `{ id?, type: "get_messages" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_messages_page", cursor?: string, limit?: number }`

`get_messages_page` returns a stable chronological page with `messages`, `totalMessages`, and an opaque `nextCursor`. Cursors are bound to the session id, durable leaf, and message count. `session_busy` and `stale_cursor` are machine-readable failure codes. Pages contain at most 256 messages. The bundled clients drain pages automatically and fall back to the legacy `get_messages` snapshot when a page walk becomes busy or stale.

### Login

- `{ id?, type: "get_login_providers" }`
- `{ id?, type: "login", providerId: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "logout", providerId: string, credentialId: number }`
- `{ id?, type: "remove_login_account", providerId: string, credentialId: number }`
- `{ id?, type: "remove_provider_credentials", providerId: string }`

Login flows use `extension_ui_request` for `input` and `open_url`; a provider may request manual input before it produces a URL. The host answers input requests with `extension_ui_response`. `get_login_providers` exposes each account's positive `credentialId`. `logout` and `remove_login_account` remove exactly that account and preserve siblings. `logout` without a valid `credentialId` fails with `code: "credential_id_required"`; this is a breaking change for clients that previously used provider-wide logout. The explicitly destructive `remove_provider_credentials` command removes every stored credential for the provider.

### MCP administration

- `{ id?, type: "mcp_add_server", name: string, config: MCPServerConfig, scope: MCPAddScope }`
- `{ id?, type: "mcp_remove_server", name: string, scope: MCPAddScope }`
- `{ id?, type: "mcp_set_server_enabled", name: string, enabled: boolean }`
- `{ id?, type: "mcp_reload" }`
- `{ id?, type: "mcp_reconnect_server", name: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "mcp_unauth_server", name: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "mcp_begin_reauth", name: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "mcp_complete_reauth", flowId: string, completion?: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "mcp_cancel_reauth", flowId: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "mcp_begin_smithery_login" }`
- `{ id?, type: "mcp_complete_smithery_login", sessionId: string, apiKey?: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "mcp_logout_smithery" }`
- `{ id?, type: "mcp_search_registry", query: string, limit?: number, semantic?: boolean }`
- `{ id?, type: "mcp_deploy_registry_result", result: SmitherySearchResult, scope: MCPAddScope, name?: string, values: Record<string, string> }`

These commands mutate both persisted MCP configuration and the live manager where applicable. Reload performs complete live rediscovery and tool refresh; reconnect and unauth replace one server's live tools. Reauthentication is a proactive begin/complete/cancel flow that returns authorization data instead of opening a browser. Smithery commands cover login, logout, registry search, and deployment of a selected result.

### Diagnostics

- `{ id?, type: "start_cpu_profile" }`
- `{ id?, type: "stop_cpu_profile" }`
- `{ id?, type: "create_heap_profile" }`
- `{ id?, type: "create_support_bundle" }`
- `{ id?, type: "create_work_profile" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_recent_logs", maxLines?: number, olderDays?: number }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_raw_sse" }`
- `{ id?, type: "subscribe_raw_sse" }`
- `{ id?, type: "unsubscribe_raw_sse" }`
- `{ id?, type: "start_inspector" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_system_info" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_startup_warnings" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_artifacts_directory" }`
- `{ id?, type: "clear_artifact_cache", daysOld?: number }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_mcp_auth_challenges" }`
- `{ id?, type: "resolve_mcp_auth_challenge", challengeId: string, config?: MCPServerConfig }`

Profile, support-bundle, artifacts-directory, and work-profile responses expose their artifact `path`; the inspector returns `{ host, port }`. `get_raw_sse` is a one-shot snapshot, while subscription commands control `raw_sse_update` forwarding. An MCP authentication challenge blocks its tool call until `resolve_mcp_auth_challenge`; omitting `config` deliberately rejects the call.

### Voice

- `{ id?, type: "start_live", voice?: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "stop_live" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_live_status" }`
- `{ id?, type: "toggle_live_mute" }`
- `{ id?, type: "start_stt" }`
- `{ id?, type: "stop_stt" }`
- `{ id?, type: "toggle_stt" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_stt_status" }`
- `{ id?, type: "speak_text", text: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "clear_speech" }`
- `{ id?, type: "duck_speech" }`
- `{ id?, type: "unduck_speech" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_speech_status" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_speech_settings", enabled?: boolean, mode?: "all" | "assistant" | "yield" }`

Realtime `/live` and harness-side microphone STT emit `voice_event` frames. Speech commands control harness audio playback; automatic assistant vocalization follows the persisted speech settings and the same streamed session events used by the TUI.

### Collaboration

- `{ id?, type: "start_collab_hosting", relayUrl?: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "stop_collab_hosting" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_collab_status" }`
- `{ id?, type: "join_collab_session", link: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "leave_collab_session" }`

After `join_collab_session` makes the RPC session a guest, `prompt`, `steer`, `follow_up`, `abort`, and `abort_and_prompt` are routed to the authoritative host instead of mutating the local replica. Normal prompt, steer, and follow-up share the collab protocol's host-side steer path. The guest mirror reports `"current"` when relayed input joins an active remote run and `"future"` when the host is idle, so SDK reservations follow server-owned state. Session-changing entrypoints (`new_session`, `switch_session`, `branch`, `fork`, `branch_btw`, active-session deletion, plan approval with `strategy: "execute"`, and loops with `action: "reset"`) fail with `code: "operation_failed"` and instruct the client to call `leave_collab_session`; deleting a non-active session remains allowed. A guest-routing failure uses `code: "not_guest"`, `"read_only"`, or `"link_unavailable"` so clients need not match error text. Remote host dialog requests are relayed as `extension_ui_request` and answered with `extension_ui_response`; dialog cancellation is also relayed.

## Response Schema

All command results use `RpcResponse`:

- Success: `{ id?, type: "response", command: <command>, success: true, data?: ... }`
- Failure: `{ id?, type: "response", command: string, success: false, error: string, code?: string }`

Data payloads are command-specific and defined in `rpc-types.ts`.

### Prompt scheduling payloads

`prompt` and `abort_and_prompt` are acknowledged after the command is accepted, not after a model turn finishes:

```json
{
  "id": "req_1",
  "type": "response",
  "command": "prompt",
  "success": true,
  "data": { "agentInvoked": false, "lifecycleDisposition": "none" }
}
```

`data.agentInvoked: false` with `"none"` is an immediate outcome for local-only prompts, including slash commands that produce output without starting an agent turn. `data.agentInvoked: true` means the agent-facing input path handled the prompt; `"current"` and `"future"` identify the run reservation it owns. Older runtimes may omit `data`; current runtimes always follow every successful `prompt` and `abort_and_prompt` with one correlated terminal outcome.

`prompt_result` carries that outcome:

```json
[
  { "type": "prompt_result", "id": "req_1", "agentInvoked": false, "lifecycleDisposition": "none" },
  { "type": "prompt_result", "id": "req_2", "agentInvoked": true, "lifecycleDisposition": "current" },
  { "type": "prompt_result", "id": "req_3", "agentInvoked": true, "lifecycleDisposition": "future" }
]
```

Local-only slash commands may emit `command_output` frames before their `prompt_result`; they do not emit `agent_end`. An extension-injected send is included in the correlated result only after its task settles. A guest steer or follow-up can join an active host run (`"current"`), while a queued prompt owns a later run (`"future"`).

### `get_state` payload

`tokensPerSecond` is a number when output throughput is available and `null`
otherwise. `fastModeEnabled` reports the session setting, while
`fastModeActive` reports the actual computed active state. For Fireworks,
`providers.fireworksTier: priority` is a provider-level setting independent of
the `/fast` family setting, so `fastModeActive` may remain `true` for an
unsupported Fireworks model.

For direct Anthropic, a provider rejection of `speed: "fast"` uses a sticky
fallback scoped by the resolved endpoint and exact model: `fastModeEnabled` may
remain `true` while `fastModeActive` is `false`. An explicit `set_fast_mode`
enable expresses retry intent and clears that fallback so the provider attempt
is re-armed.

```json
{
  "model": { "provider": "...", "id": "..." },
  "thinkingLevel": "off|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max",
  "isStreaming": false,
  "isCompacting": false,
  "isRetrying": false,
  "isBashRunning": false,
  "isAborting": false,
  "isGeneratingHandoff": false,
  "steeringMode": "all|one-at-a-time",
  "followUpMode": "all|one-at-a-time",
  "interruptMode": "immediate|wait",
  "sessionFile": "...",
  "sessionId": "...",
  "sessionName": "...",
  "fastModeEnabled": false,
  "tokensPerSecond": null,
  "fastModeActive": false,
  "autoCompactionEnabled": true,
  "messageCount": 0,
  "queuedMessageCount": 0,
  "todoPhases": [
    {
      "id": "phase-1",
      "name": "Todos",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "id": "task-1",
          "content": "Map the tool surface",
          "status": "in_progress"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "systemPrompt": ["..."],
  "dumpTools": [
    {
      "name": "read",
      "description": "Read files and URLs",
      "parameters": {}
    }
  ],
  "contextUsage": {
    "tokens": 1100,
    "contextWindow": 200000,
    "percent": 0.55
  },
  "configWarnings": [],
  "skillWarnings": [
    { "skillPath": "C:\\agent\\skills\\example\\SKILL.md", "message": "..." }
  ]
}
```

`model`, `thinkingLevel`, `sessionFile`, `sessionName`, `systemPrompt`, `dumpTools`, and `contextUsage` are optional. The activity flags are live snapshots; clients should refresh state after transitions instead of deriving them from command acknowledgements alone.

### `get_theme` payload

The maps below are deliberately truncated to representative entries; the real response contains every semantic color token and every symbol key. Color values are hex strings or `null` when the theme defers to the terminal default.

```json
{
  "name": "titanium",
  "isLight": false,
  "colorMode": "truecolor",
  "symbolPreset": "unicode",
  "colorBlindMode": false,
  "colors": {
    "accent": "#7aa2f7",
    "border": null,
    "text": "#c0caf5"
  },
  "symbols": {
    "status.success": "✔",
    "nav.cursor": "❯",
    "icon.model": "⬢"
  },
  "statusLineLuminance": 0.08,
  "accentSurfaceLuminance": 0.24
}
```

### `get_repo_status` payload

```json
{
  "cwd": "C:\\work\\project",
  "vcs": "git",
  "root": "C:\\work\\project",
  "branch": "feature/rpc-ui",
  "detached": false,
  "staged": 1,
  "unstaged": 2,
  "untracked": 3,
  "pr": {
    "number": 123,
    "url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123"
  }
}
```

Outside a repository, `vcs`, `root`, `branch`, and `pr` are `null`, the counts are zero, and `detached` is `false`. A detached Git checkout has `vcs: "git"`, `branch: null`, and `detached: true`; Jujutsu reports `vcs: "jj"`.

### `get_session_view` payload

```json
{
  "mode": "plan",
  "activeModes": ["plan", "goal"],
  "autoThinking": true,
  "resolvedThinkingLevel": "high",
  "fastMode": false,
  "advisorEnabled": true,
  "advisors": [
    { "name": "security", "status": "running" }
  ],
  "usingSubscription": true,
  "cwd": "C:\\work\\project",
  "projectDir": "C:\\work\\project",
  "activeRepo": {
    "cwd": "C:\\work\\project",
    "relativeRepoRoot": "."
  },
  "worktree": null
}
```

`mode` is the highest-priority active session mode (`plan`, `prewalk`, `goal`, or `vibe`) and may be `null`; `activeModes` contains all active session-owned modes in that precedence order. `resolvedThinkingLevel`, `projectDir`, `activeRepo`, and `worktree` may also be `null`. Advisor status is one of `running`, `paused`, `quota_exhausted`, `error`, or `no_model`.

### `complete` payload

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "value": "/model",
      "label": "/model",
      "description": "Select a model"
    }
  ],
  "prefix": "  /mod"
}
```

Each item has `value`, `label`, and optional `description` and `kind`. After choosing an item, send it back with the original `lines` and `cursor` to `apply_completion`; the applied payload is the replacement editor state:

```json
{
  "lines": ["  /model "],
  "cursor": { "line": 0, "column": 9 }
}
```

### `get_settings` payload

`get_settings` returns tab metadata and one descriptor for every schema path. `value` and `default` are always present, using `null` for undefined values and defaults; credential values are also redacted to `null` while `configured` still reports whether a value exists.

```json
{
  "tabs": [
    {
      "id": "appearance",
      "label": "Appearance",
      "icon": "tab.appearance",
      "groups": ["Theme", "Status Line", "Display", "Images"]
    }
  ],
  "settings": [
    {
      "path": "retry.enabled",
      "type": "boolean",
      "value": true,
      "default": true,
      "configured": false,
      "secret": false,
      "nullable": false
    },
    {
      "path": "computer.backend",
      "type": "enum",
      "value": "auto",
      "default": "auto",
      "configured": false,
      "secret": false,
      "nullable": false,
      "values": ["auto", "native"],
      "ui": {
        "tab": "tools",
        "group": "Computer",
        "label": "Computer Backend",
        "description": "Select automatic or explicit platform-native desktop capture and input",
        "options": [
          { "value": "auto", "label": "Auto" },
          { "value": "native", "label": "Native" }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "path": "auth.broker.token",
      "type": "string",
      "value": null,
      "default": null,
      "configured": true,
      "secret": true,
      "nullable": true
    },
    {
      "path": "theme.dark",
      "type": "string",
      "value": "titanium",
      "default": "titanium",
      "configured": false,
      "secret": false,
      "nullable": false,
      "ui": {
        "tab": "appearance",
        "group": "Theme",
        "label": "Dark Theme",
        "description": "Theme used when the terminal has a dark background",
        "options": [{ "value": "titanium", "label": "titanium" }]
      }
    },
    {
      "path": "shellMinimizer.legacyFilters",
      "type": "boolean",
      "value": null,
      "default": null,
      "configured": false,
      "secret": false,
      "nullable": true
    }
  ]
}
```

`set_setting` returns `{ path, value, configured }`; credential values are redacted to `null`. Validation failures use `unknown_setting` or `invalid_value`, and a persisted setting whose runtime effect fails uses `effect_failed`.

### `get_sessions` payload

`total` is the filtered count before `limit`; entries omit the full-text-only `allMessagesText` field.

```json
{
  "sessions": [
    {
      "path": "C:\\sessions\\2026-07-27.jsonl",
      "id": "session_123",
      "cwd": "C:\\work\\project",
      "title": "RPC parity",
      "parentSessionPath": "C:\\sessions\\parent.jsonl",
      "created": "2026-07-27T10:00:00.000Z",
      "modified": "2026-07-27T10:30:00.000Z",
      "messageCount": 12,
      "size": 18432,
      "firstMessage": "Document the RPC protocol",
      "status": "completed"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

### `set_fast_mode` payload

`set_fast_mode` changes whether fast mode is enabled for the session. The
request is:

```json
{ "id": "req_fast_on", "type": "set_fast_mode", "enabled": true }
```

On success, `data` always contains both `enabled` and `active`. These are the
actual computed values: `enabled` reports the session setting, and `active`
reports the resulting active state, including any provider-level Fireworks
priority setting:

For direct Anthropic, an explicit enable also re-arms a provider attempt after
the sticky rejection fallback, even when fast mode was already enabled.

```json
{
  "id": "req_fast_on",
  "type": "response",
  "command": "set_fast_mode",
  "success": true,
  "data": { "enabled": true, "active": true }
}
```

Enabling fast mode on a model without a service-tier family fails with the
exact error below:

```json
{
  "id": "req_fast_on",
  "type": "response",
  "command": "set_fast_mode",
  "success": false,
  "error": "Fast mode is unavailable for the current model."
}
```

Disabling fast mode is idempotent, including on an unsupported model. It
succeeds as an off/no-op result, but disabling `/fast` does not override
provider-level settings, so a successful disable does not guarantee
`active: false`. For example, with an unsupported
`fireworks/deepseek-v4-flash` model and `providers.fireworksTier: priority`,
the response reports the session setting as disabled while the provider
priority keeps the computed active state true:

```json
{
  "id": "req_fast_off",
  "type": "response",
  "command": "set_fast_mode",
  "success": true,
  "data": { "enabled": false, "active": true }
}
```

The corresponding `get_state` result reports the same computed state:

```json
{
  "fastModeEnabled": false,
  "fastModeActive": true
}
```

### `set_todos` payload

Replaces the in-memory todo state for the current session and returns the normalized phase list:

```json
{
  "id": "req_2",
  "type": "set_todos",
  "phases": [
    {
      "id": "phase-1",
      "name": "Evaluation",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "id": "task-1",
          "content": "Map the read tool surface",
          "status": "in_progress"
        },
        {
          "id": "task-2",
          "content": "Exercise edit operations",
          "status": "pending"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This is useful for hosts that want to pre-seed a plan before the first prompt.

### `set_host_tools` payload

Replaces the current set of host-owned tools that the RPC server may call back
into over stdio:

```json
{
  "id": "req_3",
  "type": "set_host_tools",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "echo_host",
      "label": "Echo Host",
      "description": "Echo a value from the embedding host",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "message": { "type": "string" }
        },
        "required": ["message"],
        "additionalProperties": false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The response payload is:

```json
{
  "toolNames": ["echo_host"]
}
```

These tools are added to the active session tool registry before the next model
call. Re-sending `set_host_tools` replaces the previous host-owned set.

### `set_host_uri_schemes` payload

Replaces the current set of host-owned URL schemes the RPC server should
dispatch reads/writes through:

```json
{
  "id": "req_4",
  "type": "set_host_uri_schemes",
  "schemes": [
    {
      "scheme": "db",
      "description": "Virtual db row files",
      "writable": true,
      "immutable": false
    }
  ]
}
```

The response payload is:

```json
{
  "schemes": ["db"]
}
```

Schemes are case-insensitive on the wire and normalized to lowercase before
the response is sent. Re-sending `set_host_uri_schemes` replaces the entire
previous set — schemes missing from the new list are unregistered.

`security://` is reserved for OMP's producer-neutral software-security resource
store. RPC hosts cannot register or shadow that scheme.

## UI Reconstruction

### Rebuilding a UI

RPC reports the source data, not every formatted status-line value:

- `get_session_stats` supplies session token counters (`input`, `output`, `reasoning`, `cacheRead`, `cacheWrite`, and `total`), cost, and context usage. A cache-hit percentage is derived from those counters as `cacheRead / (cacheRead + cacheWrite + input)`; it is not a separate wire field.
- Compute token rate from `message_update` usage and timing, and elapsed time from `agent_start`/`agent_end`.
- The TUI's `token_total` includes orchestration input/output in addition to input, output, and cache writes. Those orchestration counters are not exposed by RPC, so an exact orchestration-inclusive total requires the client to track or supply them itself; otherwise display `get_session_stats.tokens.total` as the wire-visible total.
- `hostname` and wall-clock time are inherently local to the client.

`get_session_view` reports modes owned by the session: plan, prewalk, goal, and vibe. Loop state and limits are exposed separately by `get_loop_state`; process-wide pause state comes from `get_pause_state`. Plan snapshots expose the persisted `plan_paused` marker through `paused`; its precise semantics are described under Known non-parity.

Prompt text sent through `prompt` has `@file` mentions resolved and expanded server-side, so clients MUST NOT duplicate path resolution. The startup restriction on `@file` applies only to CLI arguments. Send images as `ImageContent[]` in the prompt payload.

To add client-owned tools, use `set_host_tools` and serve `host_tool_call` / `host_tool_update` / `host_tool_result` as described in [Host Tool Sub-Protocol](#host-tool-sub-protocol). To expose virtual files, register schemes with `set_host_uri_schemes` and implement the frames in [Host URI Sub-Protocol](#host-uri-sub-protocol).

## Event Stream Schema

RPC mode forwards `AgentSessionEvent` objects from `AgentSession.subscribe(...)`.

Common event types:

- `agent_start`, `agent_end`
- `turn_start`, `turn_end`
- `message_start`, `message_update`, `message_end`
- `tool_execution_start`, `tool_execution_update`, `tool_execution_end`
- `auto_compaction_start`, `auto_compaction_end`
- `auto_retry_start`, `auto_retry_end`
- `ttsr_triggered`
- `todo_reminder`
- `todo_auto_clear`

- `context_message_added`
Extension runner errors are emitted separately as:

```json
{
  "type": "extension_error",
  "extensionPath": "...",
  "event": "...",
  "error": "..."
}
```

`message_update` includes streaming deltas in `assistantMessageEvent` (text/thinking/toolcall deltas).

`context_message_added` is not interchangeable with `message_start`/`message_end`: it reports model-visible injected context that may never appear in normal message history. See the frame contract above and honor `display` when reconstructing the transcript.

## Prompt/Queue Concurrency and Ordering

This is the most important operational behavior.

### Immediate ack vs completion

`prompt` and `abort_and_prompt` are **acknowledged immediately**:

```json
{ "id": "req_1", "type": "response", "command": "prompt", "success": true }
```

That means:

- command acceptance != prompt outcome or run completion
- every successfully acknowledged `prompt` and `abort_and_prompt` produces one same-id `prompt_result`; a scheduling failure instead produces one same-id error response
- `prompt_result.agentInvoked: true` means handled input, not necessarily a new lifecycle
- `prompt_result.lifecycleDisposition` is `"none"` for no run, `"current"` for work merged into the active run, and `"future"` for a queued or newly starting run
- local agent runs are tracked independently through `agent_start` and `agent_end`
- `agent_end.isTerminal: false` marks an intermediate settle whose continuation is already scheduled; only an absent/true `isTerminal` completes the logical run
- `RpcClient.waitForIdle()` returns immediately when no run is active or reserved, and otherwise spans queued follow-up gaps and non-terminal settles
- `RpcClient.promptAndWait()` requires the ready-frame `prompt_result` capability, observes the correlated terminal outcome, and waits for the run selected by its lifecycle disposition. Local-only outcomes return with no reserved run; extension-injected work cannot return before its tracked send task schedules/completes a run or fails.

### While streaming

`AgentSession.prompt()` requires `streamingBehavior` during active streaming:

- `"steer"` => queued steering message (interrupt path)
- `"followUp"` => queued follow-up message (post-turn path)

If omitted during streaming, prompt fails. The TypeScript helpers accept the same value as the final optional argument to `prompt()`, `promptWithResult()`, and `promptAndWait()`; using `"followUp"` lets the correlated waiter span the active-run/queued-run gap.

### Background vs ordered dispatch

Most commands are processed in stdin order through one serialized queue. Operations that await cancellable or otherwise long-running work are dispatched in the background so their canceller or control command can overtake them:

- `bash`
- `python`
- `ask_btw`
- `compact`
- `retry`
- `handoff`
- `approve_plan_proposal`
- `reject_plan_proposal`
- `begin_guided_goal`
- `prompt_agent`
- `generate_ttsr_rule`
- `start_live`
- `start_stt`
- `toggle_stt`
- `start_collab_hosting`
- `join_collab_session`
- `mcp_add_server`
- `mcp_set_server_enabled`
- `mcp_reload`
- `mcp_reconnect_server`
- `mcp_unauth_server`
- `mcp_begin_reauth`
- `mcp_complete_reauth`
- `mcp_begin_smithery_login`
- `mcp_complete_smithery_login`
- `mcp_search_registry`
- `mcp_deploy_registry_result`

Responses from those commands can interleave with later ordered responses; clients MUST correlate by `id`. This lets `abort`, `abort_retry`, `cancel_btw`, `abort_bash`, `abort_python`, and `kill_agent` run while their target operation is pending, and lets voice, STT, collaboration, and MCP control commands overtake the corresponding network startup. `extension_ui_response`, host-tool updates/results, and host-URI results bypass the ordered queue as control frames.

### Queue defaults

From `packages/agent/src/agent.ts` defaults:

- `steeringMode`: `"one-at-a-time"`
- `followUpMode`: `"one-at-a-time"`
- `interruptMode`: `"immediate"`

### Mode semantics

- `set_steering_mode` / `set_follow_up_mode`
  - `"one-at-a-time"`: dequeue one queued message per turn
  - `"all"`: dequeue entire queue at once
- `set_interrupt_mode`
  - `"immediate"`: tool execution checks steering between tool calls; pending steering can abort remaining tool calls in the turn
  - `"wait"`: defer steering until turn completion

## Extension UI Sub-Protocol

Extensions in RPC mode use request/response UI frames.

### Known non-parity

- `plan_paused` is a persisted session-mode marker, not a live plan proposal. While paused, snapshots report `enabled: false` and `paused: true`, and `get_work_mode_state.activeMode` is not `"plan"`. The marker survives session switches; clients MUST test `plan.paused` rather than infer pause from `enabled` or `activeMode`.
- Vibe workers owned by the source session are not preserved when switching sessions. The destination session rehydrates its own vibe registry instead.
- Renderer-component members of `ExtensionUIContext` remain terminal-only: `onTerminalInput`, `setFooter`, `setHeader`, `custom`, `getToolsExpanded`/`setToolsExpanded`, and `setEditorComponent`. RPC also ignores the component-factory form of `setWidget`; string-array widgets are supported. These APIs require terminal renderer instances or renderer-owned state. `setWorkingMessage` is supported and emits an extension UI request.
- `registerShortcut` is terminal-only: it binds a key chord directly to a callback rather than registering a named capability. Extensions that need the same substantive action in a headless host use `registerCommand`; the third-party UI chooses its own keybinding. `get_keybindings` remains a read-only view of the effective terminal action map and display strings.

`getEditorText`, extension autocomplete providers, loop control, loop limits, theme access, and working-message updates are not on this list: they have RPC implementations described above, subject to the editor-cache contract.

### Outbound request

`RpcExtensionUIRequest` (`type: "extension_ui_request"`) methods:

- `select`, `confirm`, `input`, `askDialog`, `editor`
- `notify`, `setStatus`, `setWorkingMessage`, `setWidget`, `setTitle`, `set_editor_text`
- `open_url` (emitted by RPC login flows)

Session titles are client-controlled through `set_session_name` and `generate_title`; `prompt` does not generate one implicitly. An applied `generate_title` emits `session_info_update`. Extension `setTitle` UI requests are suppressed by default because many hosts have no terminal-title surface; set `PI_RPC_EMIT_TITLE=1` to emit those requests.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "extension_ui_request",
  "id": "123",
  "method": "confirm",
  "title": "Confirm",
  "message": "Continue?",
  "timeout": 30000
}
```

### Outbound cancellation

When the server aborts or times out a pending dialog, it emits `{ type: "extension_ui_cancel", targetId: string, timedOut?: boolean }`. The host MUST close the matching `extension_ui_request` surface immediately; a later response for that abandoned request is no longer useful.

### Inbound response

`RpcExtensionUIResponse` (`type: "extension_ui_response"`):

- `{ type: "extension_ui_response", id: string, value: string }`
- `{ type: "extension_ui_response", id: string, confirmed: boolean }`
- `{ type: "extension_ui_response", id: string, result: ExtensionAskDialogResult }`
- `{ type: "extension_ui_response", id: string, cancelled: true, timedOut?: boolean }`

If a dialog has a timeout, RPC mode resolves to a default value when timeout/abort fires.

## Host Tool Sub-Protocol

RPC hosts can expose custom tools to the agent by sending `set_host_tools`, then
serving execution requests over the same transport.

### Outbound request

When the agent wants the host to execute one of those tools, RPC mode emits:

```json
{
  "type": "host_tool_call",
  "id": "host_1",
  "toolCallId": "toolu_123",
  "toolName": "echo_host",
  "arguments": { "message": "hello" }
}
```

If the tool execution is later aborted, RPC mode emits:

```json
{
  "type": "host_tool_cancel",
  "id": "host_cancel_1",
  "targetId": "host_1"
}
```

### Inbound updates and completion

Hosts can optionally stream progress:

```json
{
  "type": "host_tool_update",
  "id": "host_1",
  "partialResult": {
    "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "working" }]
  }
}
```

Completion uses:

```json
{
  "type": "host_tool_result",
  "id": "host_1",
  "result": {
    "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "done" }]
  }
}
```

Set top-level `isError: true` on `host_tool_result` to reject the pending host tool call and surface the returned text content as a tool error.

## Host URI Sub-Protocol

RPC hosts can also own custom URL schemes (virtual files). After
`set_host_uri_schemes`, every read of `<scheme>://…` and write of
`<scheme>://…` (when registered as `writable`) is bounced back to the host
over the same transport.

### Outbound request

When a session tool resolves a host-owned URL, RPC mode emits:

```json
{
  "type": "host_uri_request",
  "id": "uri_1",
  "operation": "read",
  "url": "db://users/42"
}
```

Writes look the same with `"operation": "write"` and an additional
`"content": "..."` field carrying the full replacement bytes.

If the request is later aborted (caller cancels, session ends), RPC mode
emits:

```json
{
  "type": "host_uri_cancel",
  "id": "uri_cancel_1",
  "targetId": "uri_1"
}
```

### Inbound result

For successful reads:

```json
{
  "type": "host_uri_result",
  "id": "uri_1",
  "content": "id=42\nname=Alice\n",
  "contentType": "text/plain",
  "notes": ["fresh from cache"],
  "immutable": false
}
```

For successful writes, omit content:

```json
{ "type": "host_uri_result", "id": "uri_1" }
```

To reject the request, set `isError: true` and either populate `error` with
a message or fall back to `content` for textual error surfacing:

```json
{
  "type": "host_uri_result",
  "id": "uri_1",
  "isError": true,
  "error": "row 42 not found"
}
```

### Constraints

- The agent's `edit` tool does not target host URIs. Hosts that want to
  mutate virtual files expose `write` and let the model use the `write` tool
  with replacement content.
- Schemes are global to the process; `set_host_uri_schemes` replaces the
  previous set, unregistering anything not in the new list.
- Schemes are normalized to lowercase before registration.

The TypeScript `RpcClient` makes this sub-protocol usable without raw frame plumbing: call `setHostUriSchemes(...)`, then `registerHostUriHandler(handler)`. The handler receives the `RpcHostUriRequest` and an `AbortSignal`; returning a string or `RpcClientHostUriReadResult` completes a read, returning from a write acknowledges it, and throwing sends an error result. `host_uri_cancel` aborts the signal for the matching request.

## Error Model and Recoverability

### Command-level failures

Failures are `success: false` with string `error`.

```json
{
  "id": "req_2",
  "type": "response",
  "command": "set_model",
  "success": false,
  "error": "Model not found: provider/model"
}
```

### Recoverability expectations

- Most command failures are recoverable; process remains alive.
- Malformed JSONL / parse-loop exceptions emit a `parse` error response and continue reading subsequent lines.
- Empty `set_session_name` is rejected (`Session name cannot be empty`).
- Extension UI responses with unknown `id` are ignored.
- Process termination conditions are stdin close or explicit extension-triggered shutdown after the current command.

## Compact Command Flows

### 1) Prompt and stream

stdin:

```json
{ "id": "req_1", "type": "prompt", "message": "Summarize this repo" }
```

stdout sequence (typical):

```json
{ "id": "req_1", "type": "response", "command": "prompt", "success": true }
{ "type": "agent_start" }
{ "type": "message_update", "assistantMessageEvent": { "type": "text_delta", "delta": "..." }, "message": { "role": "assistant", "content": [] } }
{ "type": "agent_end", "messages": [] }
```

### 2) Prompt during streaming with explicit queue policy

stdin:

```json
{
  "id": "req_2",
  "type": "prompt",
  "message": "Also include risks",
  "streamingBehavior": "followUp"
}
```

### 3) Inspect and tune queue behavior

stdin:

```json
{ "id": "q1", "type": "get_state" }
{ "id": "q2", "type": "set_steering_mode", "mode": "all" }
{ "id": "q3", "type": "set_interrupt_mode", "mode": "wait" }
```

### 4) Extension UI round trip

stdout:

```json
{
  "type": "extension_ui_request",
  "id": "ui_7",
  "method": "input",
  "title": "Branch name",
  "placeholder": "feature/..."
}
```

stdin:

```json
{ "type": "extension_ui_response", "id": "ui_7", "value": "feature/rpc-host" }
```

## Notes on `RpcClient`

`src/modes/rpc/rpc-client.ts` is a convenience wrapper; `rpc-types.ts` remains the protocol definition.

The client spawns `bun <cliPath> --mode rpc`, negotiates protocol v2, correlates responses by generated `req_<n>` ids, exposes `onSessionEvent`/`onEvent` plus the frame-specific listeners named above, and handles registered host-tool calls through `setCustomTools()`. Provider observations require both `subscribeProviderRequestObservations()` and `onProviderRequestObservation()`; extension dialog cancellation uses `onExtensionUiCancel()`.

Typed helpers cover every command group. Host URI support uses `setHostUriSchemes()` plus `registerHostUriHandler()`, which handles request, result, cancellation, and abort signaling internally. Raw stdout handling is required only for `extension_error`, which has no dedicated listener method. For `prompt`, subscribe to both `onPromptResult()` and `onPromptError()` before calling `promptWithResult()` when every terminal outcome is required. For `abort_and_prompt`, `abortAndPromptWithResult()` returns `{ requestId }` and `onPromptError()` publishes a typed same-id `{ command: "abort_and_prompt", success: false, error, code? }` at most once.

`bash()` and `python()` are the exception to the client's 30-second request deadline because server-side execution can legitimately run longer. They wait indefinitely by default; pass `timeoutMs` in the helper options to set a client-side response deadline in milliseconds:

```ts
await client.bash("make release", { timeoutMs: 120_000 });
await client.python("train_model()", { timeoutMs: 120_000 });
```

`timeoutMs` controls only how long the TypeScript client waits. It is not serialized into the RPC command and does not limit server-side execution. Other request helpers keep the 30-second default.
