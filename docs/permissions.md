# Resource permissions

`permissions.*` answers a different question from the approval settings: not *may this tool run*, but *may it touch this path*. It is off by default.

| Axis | Setting | Question |
|---|---|---|
| Capability | `tools.approvalMode` | How much do I trust the agent overall? |
| Tool identity | `tools.approval.<tool>` | May this tool run at all? |
| Command | `bash.patterns` | May this command line run? |
| **Resource** | **`permissions.*`** | **May it touch this path?** |

See [Tool approval mode](./approval-mode.md) for the first two and [the bash tool](./tools/bash.md#bashpatterns-permission-policy) for the third.

## The one invariant

**`permissions.*` can only subtract, never grant.** A path this layer permits still faces `tools.approvalMode` and `tools.approval.<tool>` exactly as it does today. There is no value of any `permissions.*` key that auto-approves a call, and `permissions.allow.*` relaxes this layer's own rules and nothing else.

## Why it is not an approval mode

Subagents run with `tools.approvalMode: yolo` forced (`task/executor.ts`), because a headless subagent has no UI to confirm against. A path guard expressed as a fourth approval tier or a new mode would therefore be bypassed by spawning a `task`.

So this is not an approval tier. It is a hard check evaluated unconditionally in `ExtensionToolWrapper.execute` — the point every registry tool dispatch passes through — before the approval prompt is computed and independent of the active mode. A denied path fails the same way inside a subagent as it does in the main session. (One delegation seam is deliberately outside it; see [What this does not cover](#what-this-does-not-cover).)

## Profiles

```yaml
permissions:
  profile: strict
```

| Profile | Effect |
|---|---|
| `off` (default) | No enforcement. Short-circuits on one settings read, before any filesystem work. Behaviour is identical to having no permission layer at all. |
| `workspace` | Writes must land under `cwd` or a `workspace.additionalDirectories` root. Reads unrestricted. |
| `strict` | `workspace`, plus built-in deny rules for secrets, on both read and write. |

`strict` denies `**/.env`, `**/.env.*`, `**/id_rsa`, `**/id_ed25519`, `**/id_ecdsa`, `**/*.pem`, `**/*.key`, `**/*.p12`, `**/.aws/credentials`, `**/.ssh/**`, and `**/secrets.json`. It ships carve-outs for `**/.env.example` and `**/.env.sample`, so the common case needs no rule of your own.

Two defaults are deliberate:

- **Off by default.** A default-on path guard breaks every session that reads `~/.gitconfig` or `/etc/hosts`, which would be a breaking change rather than a feature.
- **Reads unconfined even under `strict`.** Reading `/var/log`, a sibling repository, or your global git config is routine. An escaping *write* is the destructive case, so that is what confinement covers by default. Set `permissions.confineReads: true` if you want the stricter reading.

## Keys

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `permissions.profile` | `off` \| `workspace` \| `strict` | `off` | Base profile. |
| `permissions.confineWrites` | boolean | profile-derived | Writes must land under a workspace root. |
| `permissions.confineReads` | boolean | `false` | Reads must land under a workspace root. |
| `permissions.deny.read` | glob list | `[]` | Merged onto the profile's rules. |
| `permissions.deny.write` | glob list | `[]` | Merged onto the profile's rules. |
| `permissions.allow.read` | glob list | `[]` | Carve-outs, evaluated first. |
| `permissions.allow.write` | glob list | `[]` | Carve-outs, evaluated first. |
| `permissions.opaqueToolScan` | `deny` \| `prompt` \| `off` | `deny` | What the literal scan does on a match. |

A profile's deny list is a floor. `permissions.deny.*` adds to it; the only way to punch a hole in it is `permissions.allow.*`. An allow carve-out only ever overrides a deny-by-name rule — it never bypasses `permissions.confineWrites`/`permissions.confineReads`. The built-in `**/.env.example`/`**/.env.sample` carve-outs exist to let a template sit beside a real secret in the workspace; `write /tmp/.env.example` is still refused under `confineWrites: true` even though the filename matches.

```yaml
permissions:
  profile: strict
  allow:
    read:
      - "config/.env.ci"
  deny:
    write:
      - "**/migrations/**"
```

## Path globs are not command globs

These are two different dialects, on purpose:

- **Command patterns** (`bash.patterns`) match a command line. `*` matches anything, including `/`.
- **Path patterns** (`permissions.*`) are `Bun.Glob`. `*` does **not** cross `/`.

So a rule that must catch a secret at any depth is written `**/.env`, **never** `*.env`. `*.env` matches `prod.env` in the current directory and nothing nested; `**/.env` matches `.env`, `svc/.env`, and `/abs/path/.env`.

Regex is not supported. A rule such as `"^git push --force"` belongs to the command axis, not this one.

Each target is matched against three spellings — the workspace-relative path, the absolute path, and the basename — so a rule written either way behaves the way it reads. A malformed pattern (`Bun.Glob` compiles anything without throwing, silently matching nothing) is rejected with a clear error when settings load, rather than leaving the path it was meant to protect silently unenforced.

## What is actually enforced

Tools split into two classes, and the split is the honest boundary of the feature.

**Class A — structured path tools.** `read`, `write`, `edit`, `glob`, `grep`, `ast_grep`, `ast_edit`, `lsp`, `debug`, `inspect_image`, `security_scan`. These declare which arguments are paths and whether each is read or written, so enforcement is sound. This is the real guardrail.

Resolution mirrors what the tool itself does, so the guard and the tool cannot disagree about which file is at stake. Both the target and its deepest existing ancestor are `realpath`-resolved, so a symlink pointing out of the workspace is caught rather than trusted; a *dangling* symlink is refused outright, because where it lands cannot be determined before the write follows it. Containment checks both the raw (lexical) spelling of a target and its resolved real path against the deny/allow lists, so a symlink alias inside the workspace whose target matches a deny rule (`safe -> .env`) cannot walk past it under a spelling the rule never saw — including when the alias is a *directory* symlink and the target beneath it does not exist yet (`safe -> .ssh`, writing `safe/new-config`), where the not-yet-created path is projected through the same resolved-ancestor spelling the containment check itself uses. Every candidate spelling is normalized to `/` before matching, since permission globs are documented and written with `/` (`**/.ssh/**`) but a Windows `path.relative`/absolute path uses `\`, which `Bun.Glob` treats as a literal, non-equivalent character.

`grep`, `ast_grep`, and `ast_edit` accept a scope root but then recurse beneath it — the pre-execution check above only ever verifies that root. After the tool runs, the gate rechecks every file it reports having actually touched (`result.details.files`) against the same policy, before the result reaches the caller; a denied file the tool already opened locally is refused rather than surfaced. `ast_edit` checks both `read` and `write` access for each touched file, not only `write` — its own dry-run preview reads every matched file to render the diff, so a `deny.read`-only rule (no matching `deny.write`) must still block it. `glob` recurses the same way, but since a filename alone carries no file content, it filters denied entries out of both its streamed preview and its final list rather than failing the whole call. `debug` is action-aware: breakpoint and inspection actions (`set_breakpoint`, `stack_trace`, …) stay Class A, since their complete filesystem surface really is the declared `file`/`program`/`cwd` fields; `launch`, `attach`, `evaluate`, `write_memory`, and `custom_request` are scanned as Class B instead, since a launched process's `args`, a raw debugger expression, or an arbitrary DAP `arguments` payload can reach paths those declared fields never name.

`write`'s `conflict://<N>`/`conflict://*` targets resolve through the pre-execution gate as a synthetic URI — it names no filesystem path the gate can act on. The real target only becomes known once the registered conflict entry is looked up, so the policy is checked again there, against the entry's actual `absolutePath`, before either a single or a bulk resolve writes anything.

`edit`'s `path`/`edits[]` target is classified `write`-only when every edit is an explicit `op: "create"` (nothing pre-existing to read), and `read`-plus-`write` otherwise — an `update` or `delete` edit (the default when `op` is omitted, e.g. the `replace` mode's shape) reads the file's current content to compute the returned diff, so a `deny.read`-only rule with no matching `deny.write` still blocks it. The same distinction applies to the hashline and `apply_patch` payload targets embedded in `input`: every hashline section requires a `read` in addition to `write` (a section header's `#TAG` snapshot hash can only come from a prior read — hashline has no "create a new file" op), and `apply_patch`'s `*** Update File`/`*** Delete File` markers get both while `*** Add File` stays `write`-only.

`ast_edit`'s staged preview defers the real write to a later `write xd://resolve` call, which carries none of the original call's arguments to name the previewed paths. Every previewed file is authorized once before the pending action is queued — a denied file never leaves something for `resolve` to blindly apply — and authorized again, against live settings, immediately before the deferred non-dry-run pass executes; a profile tightened between preview and resolve is caught before the file changes, not after.

`lsp`'s `rename` and an applied `code_actions` result can return a server-computed `WorkspaceEdit` that touches URIs beyond the input `file` — creates, renames, deletes, or a multi-file edit. Every URI in that edit is checked against the policy immediately before it is written, and a `workspace/executeCommand` a code action triggers gets the same literal scan a Class B tool gets, since a command's real filesystem surface is not statically declared. Under `permissions.opaqueToolScan: prompt`, that scan asks for interactive confirmation through the session's own UI when one is available; a headless caller with no UI fails closed rather than silently waving the command through. The same `WorkspaceEdit` check also covers a server-*initiated* `workspace/applyEdit` push and `rename_file`'s server-returned `workspace/willRenameFiles` edit, not only an edit our own outbound `rename`/`code_actions` apply requested: every `lsp` action that touches a client routes through one internal helper that stamps this call's permission context onto the shared, cached client, so whichever action last used a given client is always the one the push handler checks against. A call that has no context of its own to stamp (an internal helper invocation, not a direct tool dispatch) leaves an already-stamped client's context untouched rather than clearing it to `undefined` — which would otherwise make the next server push land at `assertWorkspaceEditAllowed` with no context to check, treating permissions as off. `definition`/`type_definition`/`implementation`/`references` filter server-returned locations the same way: the declared `file` argument is checked before the request goes out, but a symbol's definition (or a reference to it) can live in a different file entirely, and a denied one is dropped from the result rather than having its surrounding source lines surfaced. Workspace-symbol search (`action: "symbols"` with `file: "*"` or omitted) filters its server-returned `SymbolInformation[]` results the same way, since a matching symbol can live in any file across the project regardless of what was declared. Workspace-wide `diagnostics` (`file: "*"`) spawns an actual compiler over the whole project — a read surface no finite target list can authorize — so it fails closed under any policy with active `permissions.deny.read` rules *or* `permissions.confineReads: true`, instead of running unchecked (a `confineReads`-only policy with no `deny.read` globs previously slipped through, since the check looked only at the deny list); a narrower `diagnostics` call is authorized against its declared `file` and, when that names a glob, against every concrete file it expands to.

**Class B — opaque tools.** `bash`, `eval`, `browser`, `computer`, `hub`, `debug`'s execution/evaluate actions, `lsp`'s `request` action, and every MCP or extension tool. These take arbitrary code, and sound enforcement against arbitrary code is undecidable: `cat .env` can be written `$(echo Lmk|base64 -d)`, and no static scan catches that.

They get a best-effort literal scan instead. Shell arguments are tokenized the same way `bash.patterns` tokenizes them; other tools' string arguments are walked and split. A literal reference to a denied path is refused. The scan is bounded — a resource cap on how many literals one call contributes is enforced incrementally, so one oversized argument cannot grow that bound past its limit before matching even starts. Every candidate spelling (the literal itself, its resolved absolute path, its workspace-relative path, its basename) is normalized to `/` before matching, the same way the structured-path check is, so a Windows-spelled literal (`C:\Users\me\.ssh\config`) or a `\`-separated relative path is not silently missed by a `/`-written deny rule.

> **The Class B scan is defence against accidents and naive prompt injection. It is not a sandbox.** Do not configure a deny list and conclude that shell cannot reach those files. The real boundary for arbitrary code is `tools.approval.bash: deny`, which already exists and is untouched by this layer.

`permissions.opaqueToolScan: prompt` turns a scan hit into an interactive confirmation instead of a refusal. `off` disables the scan entirely and leaves only Class A enforcement. A headless caller (subagent, `-p`, RPC, ACP) that hits a required prompt with no UI available sees recovery options that match what actually fired — permission-layer settings for a permission denial, approval-tier settings for an ordinary `tools.approval` prompt — not a generic list that cannot clear either.

Unknown MCP and extension tools are treated as Class B, not as pathless — a tool this codebase has never seen may well take a `path` argument.

`security_scan`'s working-tree digest (used to fingerprint a preflight plan and detect staleness before `start`), and a `ref_diff` target's diff text — both for its own fingerprint and for what the review session actually reads — exclude any file matching `permissions.deny.read` that is not separately carved back out by `permissions.allow.read`, evaluated fresh from live settings at both preflight and start time. An allowed file (e.g. strict's own `**/.env.example` carve-out) still contributes normally, so a change to it is not silently invisible to the staleness check. Preflight authorizes the scan's *effective* output directory as a write target — including the default one it computes when `output_root` is omitted — before creating anything under it, and before opening the underlying scan store at all, so a denied call leaves no store state (project directory, index) behind on disk either, not only an unauthorized output directory.

`github`'s `pr_checkout` is otherwise pathless — an operation, not a path argument — but the worktree it creates always lands under a fixed internal directory (`~/.omp/wt/...`), outside every session root. That effective worktree path is authorized as a write target before it is created or populated, so `permissions.confineWrites` applies to it exactly as it does to any other write, even though `github` declares no path argument for the gate to see.

## Workspace roots

Confinement measures against `cwd` plus `workspace.additionalDirectories`, read from the live session, so `/add-dir` and `/remove-dir` take effect immediately.

An isolated worktree subagent is created with `workspace.additionalDirectories` cleared and its own cwd, so its roots collapse to the worktree alone — it cannot write back into the parent checkout under `workspace` or `strict`.

## Exemptions

Internal URLs are not user filesystem targets and are never denied: `local://`, `xd://`, `memory://`, `skill://`, `artifact://`, `agent://`, `history://`, `issue://`, `pr://`, `rule://`, `security://`, `mcp://`, `omp://`. `http(s)://` is likewise not a path. Denying these would break artifact and device routing without protecting a single file.

**`ssh://` and `vault://` are not exempt.** `ssh://` is a real remote filesystem surface reachable via `read`/`write`/`grep`, so `read ssh://host/home/user/.env` faces the same deny/allow globs as the local spelling, matched against the URL's remote path and its basename. Confinement does not apply to it — there is no local root to measure a remote path against — but deny/allow-by-name rules do. An `ssh://` URL with no resolvable remote path fails closed. `vault://` addresses a real local file through the Obsidian integration's cached-root indirection; once resolved it gets full local-path treatment, confinement included. Resolution failure — `vault.enabled: false`, no vault root cached yet (the very first `vault://` call in a session, before any read has discovered one), or a target escaping the vault root — fails closed the same way an unresolvable plain path does.

## Failure behaviour

Every denial names the exact rule that fired and the setting to change, and that text is surfaced to the model so it adapts instead of retrying the same call:

```
Reading ".env" is blocked by the resource permission rule "**/.env" (permissions.profile: strict).
To allow it: add "**/.env" to permissions.allow.read, or set permissions.profile: off.
```

Resolution failures fail closed. Once a profile is active, a path argument that cannot be resolved to an absolute location is denied rather than waved through — "we could not tell what this touches" is not a reason to allow it.

## What this does not cover

- **OS-level sandboxing.** No `seccomp`, `landlock`, or `sandbox-exec`. A process the agent spawns is bounded by your OS, not by this.
- **The TOCTOU window.** A symlink can be re-pointed between the check and the open. Closing that needs `O_NOFOLLOW` plumbed through every tool.
- **Anything a Class B tool does indirectly.** See above; that is the point of stating the boundary rather than implying the deny list covers shell.
- **Extension `ctx.invokeTool` delegation.** That call reaches the native tool directly, by design, so a wrapper extension inherits the approval its own call already cleared. It is not re-gated, so an installed extension that re-registers a built-in is inside the trust boundary. (The `xd://` device route *is* gated: it dispatches through the wrapped tool.)
- **Scan literals the tokenizer cannot see.** The Class B scan skips single-character tokens and anything starting with `-`, and caps how many literals one call contributes. All three are why it is called best-effort.
