# Resource permissions

`permissions.*` answers a different question from the approval settings: not *may this tool run*, but *may it touch this path*. It is off by default.

| Axis | Setting | Question |
|---|---|---|
| Capability | `tools.approvalMode` | How much do I trust the agent overall? |
| Tool identity | `tools.approval.<tool>` | May this tool run at all? |
| Command | `bash.patterns` | May this command line run? |
| **Resource** | **`permissions.*`** | **May it touch this path?** |

See [Tool approval mode](./approval-mode.md) for the first two and [the bash tool](./tools/bash.md#bashpatterns-permission-policy) for the third.

## The one invariant

**`permissions.*` can only subtract, never grant.** A path this layer permits still faces `tools.approvalMode` and `tools.approval.<tool>` exactly as it does today. There is no value of any `permissions.*` key that auto-approves a call, and `permissions.allow.*` relaxes this layer's own rules and nothing else.

## Why it is not an approval mode

Subagents run with `tools.approvalMode: yolo` forced (`task/executor.ts`), because a headless subagent has no UI to confirm against. A path guard expressed as a fourth approval tier or a new mode would therefore be bypassed by spawning a `task`.

So this is not an approval tier. It is a hard check evaluated unconditionally in `ExtensionToolWrapper.execute` — the point every registry tool dispatch passes through — before the approval prompt is computed and independent of the active mode. A denied path fails the same way inside a subagent as it does in the main session. (One delegation seam is deliberately outside it; see [What this does not cover](#what-this-does-not-cover).)

## Profiles

```yaml
permissions:
  profile: strict
```

| Profile | Effect |
|---|---|
| `off` (default) | No enforcement. Short-circuits on one settings read, before any filesystem work. Behaviour is identical to having no permission layer at all. |
| `workspace` | Writes must land under `cwd` or a `workspace.additionalDirectories` root. Reads unrestricted. |
| `strict` | `workspace`, plus built-in deny rules for secrets, on both read and write. |

`strict` denies `**/.env`, `**/.env.*`, `**/id_rsa`, `**/id_ed25519`, `**/id_ecdsa`, `**/*.pem`, `**/*.key`, `**/*.p12`, `**/.aws/credentials`, `**/.ssh/**`, and `**/secrets.json`. It ships carve-outs for `**/.env.example` and `**/.env.sample`, so the common case needs no rule of your own. Those carve-outs relax the secret deny rules only — they do not relax confinement, so `strict` still refuses to write `/tmp/.env.example` outside every workspace root. `/perm` reports them on their own `Deny carve-out` line for exactly that reason.

Two defaults are deliberate:

- **Off by default.** A default-on path guard breaks every session that reads `~/.gitconfig` or `/etc/hosts`, which would be a breaking change rather than a feature.
- **Reads unconfined even under `strict`.** Reading `/var/log`, a sibling repository, or your global git config is routine. An escaping *write* is the destructive case, so that is what confinement covers by default. Set `permissions.confineReads: true` if you want the stricter reading.

## Keys

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `permissions.profile` | `off` \| `workspace` \| `strict` | `off` | Base profile. |
| `permissions.confineWrites` | boolean | profile-derived | Writes must land under a workspace root. |
| `permissions.confineReads` | boolean | `false` | Reads must land under a workspace root. |
| `permissions.deny.read` | glob list | `[]` | Merged onto the profile's rules. |
| `permissions.deny.write` | glob list | `[]` | Merged onto the profile's rules. |
| `permissions.allow.read` | glob list | `[]` | Carve-outs, evaluated first — they outrank both the deny rules and confinement. |
| `permissions.allow.write` | glob list | `[]` | Carve-outs, evaluated first — they outrank both the deny rules and confinement. |
| `permissions.opaqueToolScan` | `deny` \| `prompt` \| `off` | `deny` | What the literal scan does on a match. |

A profile's deny list is a floor. `permissions.deny.*` adds to it; the only way to punch a hole in it is `permissions.allow.*`.

`permissions.allow.*` is the full escape hatch: naming a path there is an explicit statement that it is in bounds, so it wins over the deny rules *and* over `confineReads`/`confineWrites`. A profile's own carve-outs are deliberately weaker — see `strict` above.

```yaml
permissions:
  profile: strict
  allow:
    read:
      - "config/.env.ci"
  deny:
    write:
      - "**/migrations/**"
```

## Inspecting and switching at runtime

`/perm` with no argument prints the active profile, the rules it resolves to, and the tool-class breakdown — including which tools are Class B and therefore only literal-scanned. That last part is deliberate: a command that reported a profile without naming what it cannot guard would imply a stronger guarantee than this layer provides.

```
/perm                # report the active profile, effective rules, and tool coverage
/perm off            # disable enforcement for this session
/perm workspace      # confine writes to the workspace roots
/perm strict         # workspace confinement plus the built-in secret deny globs
```

A switch is **session-scoped**: it is a runtime override, never written to settings. The report prints `permissions.profile` so you know the key to set for persistence.

While a profile is active the status line carries a `perm:<profile>` chip. It is hidden at `profile: off`, so a session that never enables the layer looks exactly as it did before. The chip is the `permissions` status-line segment and can be reordered or removed like any other via `statusLine.leftSegments` / `statusLine.rightSegments`.

## Path globs are not command globs

These are two different dialects, on purpose:

- **Command patterns** (`bash.patterns`) match a command line. `*` matches anything, including `/`.
- **Path patterns** (`permissions.*`) are `Bun.Glob`. `*` does **not** cross `/`.

So a rule that must catch a secret at any depth is written `**/.env`, **never** `*.env`. `*.env` matches `prod.env` in the current directory and nothing nested; `**/.env` matches `.env`, `svc/.env`, and `/abs/path/.env`.

Regex is not supported. A rule such as `"^git push --force"` belongs to the command axis, not this one.

Each target is matched against three spellings — the workspace-relative path, the absolute path, and the basename — so a rule written either way behaves the way it reads.

## What is actually enforced

Tools split into two classes, and the split is the honest boundary of the feature.

**Class A — structured path tools.** `read`, `write`, `edit`, `glob`, `grep`, `ast_grep`, `ast_edit`, `lsp`, `debug`, `inspect_image`, `security_scan`, and `learn` declare which arguments are paths and whether each is read or written, so enforcement is sound. For `learn`, the local-backend `learned.md` and any optional managed `SKILL.md` are derived from the session before the call runs. This is the real guardrail.

`debug` and `lsp` are Class A for most actions and Class B for the ones that reach arbitrary code — `debug` `launch`/`attach`/`evaluate`/`write_memory`/`custom_request`, and `lsp` `request`. Those name a program or a raw protocol payload rather than the files they end up touching, so they fall back to the literal scan. `/perm` lists them on their own `Class A/B` line with the exact actions.

Access follows what an operation does, not which argument it came from. `edit` opens the file it rewrites — patch and replace modes read it to locate the edit, and a mismatch error quotes the closest real source line — so an edit target is checked against the read rules as well as the write rules. Only paths that are produced rather than consulted (a rename destination, `*** Add File`, `MV DEST`) are write-only.

Resolution mirrors what the tool itself does, so the guard and the tool cannot disagree about which file is at stake. Both the target and its deepest existing ancestor are `realpath`-resolved, so a symlink pointing out of the workspace is caught rather than trusted; a *dangling* symlink is refused outright, because where it lands cannot be determined before the write follows it.

Several Class A tools reach past their declared arguments and are checked a second time, because the declared arguments are not the whole surface:

- `grep`, `ast_grep`, and `ast_edit` take a scope root and then recurse beneath it. Their native traversal receives the exact permitted candidate set before it opens any content, so a denied descendant neither reaches the model nor acts as a content-predicate oracle. A denial also discards any preview the call staged, so the pending `xd://resolve` cannot apply it afterwards.
- `lsp` `rename` and `code_actions --apply` receive a `WorkspaceEdit` chosen by the *language server*, which can name destinations the call never mentioned. Every path such an edit would create, modify, rename, or delete is checked before anything is written — text edits against both the read and write rules (they read the current content before rewriting it), a create/rename/delete only against the write rules, and a directory-scoped rename or delete expands to every file that currently exists beneath it. A server can also push an unsolicited `workspace/applyEdit`; that path has no `AgentToolContext` of its own, so it is checked against a permission context (session settings and live `workspace.additionalDirectories`) stamped onto the LSP client the last time a tool call used it — not skipped.
- `read` accepts several paths flattened into one string (`read({ path: "README.md;.env" })`) and splits them at execution time with `splitDelimitedPathEntry`, then reads each part without re-entering the wrapper. Every part is checked against the read rules using that same splitter, so the combined literal cannot walk a component past a deny glob.
- `lsp` `definition`, `type_definition`, `implementation`, and `references` return locations the *server* chose, and each one's surrounding source lines are read and shown. Every returned location is checked before its context is opened. `rename_file`'s `willRenameFiles` edits get the same treatment as the other workspace edits.
- `security_scan` resolves its full file scope, canonical knowledge-base paths, and effective output root during `preflight`, then rechecks all three when a saved plan starts. A default `target_kind: "repository"` scan declares no read path yet hashes and reviews every tracked and untracked in-scope file, so a tracked `.env` fails under `strict` before any content is read. Knowledge-base paths always resolve from the repository root, not the session subdirectory. An omitted `output_root` is defaulted to a directory under the security state root, and the effective root is checked before it is created.

  Note the consequence: a scan output directory must live outside the scanned repository by design, so under `workspace` or `strict` a scan needs that directory in scope — add it with `/add-dir`, or add a `permissions.allow.write` glob for it. The denial names the setting to change.

`github` is classified pathless — most of its operations (`pr_view`, `pr_diff`, `pr_create`, …) carry no filesystem path, so `/perm` lists it on the `No filesystem surface` line. `pr_checkout` is the one exception: it rewrites branch config under the repository root and, the first time a given PR is checked out, materializes a worktree beneath `~/.omp/wt/`, which sits outside every workspace root. It authorizes the repository root (read and write) and the worktree path (write) itself, independently of the pathless classification, before any git mutation runs — including the disambiguated `-2`, `-3`, … sibling a path collision falls back to, not just the nominal path.

**Class B — opaque tools.** `bash`, `eval`, `browser`, `computer`, `hub`, and every MCP or extension tool. These take arbitrary code, and sound enforcement against arbitrary code is undecidable: `cat .env` can be written `$(echo Lmk|base64 -d)`, and no static scan catches that.

They get a best-effort literal scan instead. Shell arguments are tokenized the same way `bash.patterns` tokenizes them; other tools' string arguments are walked and split. A literal reference to a denied path is refused.

> **The Class B scan is defence against accidents and naive prompt injection. It is not a sandbox.** Do not configure a deny list and conclude that shell cannot reach those files. The real boundary for arbitrary code is `tools.approval.bash: deny`, which already exists and is untouched by this layer.

`permissions.opaqueToolScan: prompt` turns a scan hit into an interactive confirmation instead of a refusal. `off` disables the scan entirely and leaves only Class A enforcement.

Unknown MCP and extension tools are treated as Class B, not as pathless — a tool this codebase has never seen may well take a `path` argument.

## Workspace roots

Confinement measures against `cwd` plus `workspace.additionalDirectories`, read from the live session, so `/add-dir` and `/remove-dir` take effect immediately.

An isolated worktree subagent is created with `workspace.additionalDirectories` cleared and its own cwd, so its roots collapse to the worktree alone — it cannot write back into the parent checkout under `workspace` or `strict`.

## Exemptions

Internal URLs are not user filesystem targets and are never denied: `local://`, `vault://`, `xd://`, `memory://`, `skill://`, `artifact://`, `agent://`, `history://`, `issue://`, `pr://`, `rule://`, `security://`, `mcp://`, `omp://`. `http(s)://` is likewise not a path. Denying these would break artifact and device routing without protecting a single file.

`ssh://` is not one of these — it names a real path on a remote host, so it is checked, just not confined. There is no local root to measure a remote path against, so `confineWrites`/`confineReads` never apply to it, but `permissions.deny.*` and `permissions.allow.*` do: the URL's remote path and its basename are matched against the same glob lists a local path faces, and a match denies it exactly like a local file would be.

## Failure behaviour

Every denial names the exact rule that fired and the setting to change, and that text is surfaced to the model so it adapts instead of retrying the same call:

```
Reading ".env" is blocked by the resource permission rule "**/.env" (permissions.profile: strict).
To allow it: add "**/.env" to permissions.allow.read, or set permissions.profile: off.
```

Resolution failures fail closed. Once a profile is active, a path argument that cannot be resolved to an absolute location is denied rather than waved through — "we could not tell what this touches" is not a reason to allow it.

## What this does not cover

- **OS-level sandboxing.** No `seccomp`, `landlock`, or `sandbox-exec`. A process the agent spawns is bounded by your OS, not by this.
- **The TOCTOU window.** A symlink can be re-pointed between the check and the open. Closing that needs `O_NOFOLLOW` plumbed through every tool.
- **Anything a Class B tool does indirectly.** See above; that is the point of stating the boundary rather than implying the deny list covers shell.
- **Extension `ctx.invokeTool` delegation.** That call reaches the native tool directly, by design, so a wrapper extension inherits the approval its own call already cleared. It is not re-gated, so an installed extension that re-registers a built-in is inside the trust boundary. (The `xd://` device route *is* gated: it dispatches through the wrapped tool.)
- **Scan literals the tokenizer cannot see.** The Class B scan skips single-character tokens and anything starting with `-`, and caps how many literals one call contributes. All three are why it is called best-effort.
